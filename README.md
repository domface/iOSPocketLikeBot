In OAuth.m, add your Access Tokens for your Instagram account. I would recommend 12 for maximum performance.

To create Access Tokens, i would use a service like python-instagram 
https://github.com/Instagram/python-instagram and leverage the get-access-token.py file 
to make this possible


Once you've added access tokens, run it and let her rip! Each time you add a hashtag, this hashtag
is added to a Mutable Array so you can have as many hashtags as you'd like.
